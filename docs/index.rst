pynuml Documentation
====================

**pynuml** is a python package providing a data interface for machine learning in neutrino physics. It utilises the **NuML** HDF5 event file format to efficiently preprocess physics events into ML objects for training neural networks. It is designed to abstract away many aspects of a typical ML workflow:

- Efficiently iterate over large HDF5 datasets
- Generate semantic and instance labels for particles
- Preprocess events into ML objects
